a is to b as c is to d


Inverse opperations are higher order functions

you cant add numbers like you cant add points

but you can add a difference of numbers to a number like adding a vector to a point

the difference, the vector is like a higher order function, or an arrow


number

subtract(identity, number) -> higher order function that takes an argument

d = difference function that finds the difference between two elements and returns a function

d(0,3) returns function that adds 3 to the argument

d(0,3)(2) = 5


r is function that finds ratio

r(d(0,1),d(0,3))(d(0,4)) = d(0,12)




4 number

(4,0) additive number (+ 4 - 0)

((4,0),(1,0)) multiplicative number (* (4 - 0) / (1 - 0))

((4,0),(1,0),(2,0),(1,0))) exponential number 


These rules could be used to contruct a universal operator function

except this one wouldnt require identity or operation index arguments

it would just work with the differences between numbers



f n i =
	f x =


(a,o) = + (a - o)

(a,o)(u,o) = * ((a - o) -* (u - o))
